    "You may have heard programmers say things like, don't duplicate code, or one function one purpose. A fundamental principle in Python programming is, \"Don't Repeat Yourself\". This means, if you find yourself writing the same code, to perform the same action more than once, you should wrap that code inside a function and then call that function elsewhere in your code. This makes your code easier to read, more modular, easier to maintain and debug and well on your way to writing professional looking code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Functions also have another advantage. Functions mean less work for us as programmers and reduce the chances that we'll make an error. If an error is discovered we also only have to change it in one place in our code, which makes fixing bugs a lot easier. "
